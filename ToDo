for each request for threads i.e EPS,OBC,etc, SPV will add the request to thread queue.
Threads will check respective queue and handle the request accordingly.
      1)Now for each threads requests can be handled sequentially or parallely
      2)sequential is straight forward :- one at a time(next element accessed when called function returned) till queue is empty. if queue is empty wait on queue.
      3)Or parallel , for each request , a temp thread is created which exits after succesful completion of task.
Classification into primary and secondary functions necessary.
